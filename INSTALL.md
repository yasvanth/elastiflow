ElastiFlow&trade; is built using the Elastic Stack, including Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana. To install and configure ElastiFlow&trade;, you must first have a working Elastic Stack environment.

Elastic Stack 7.x _*requires*_ ElastiFlow&trade; 3.5.x. To deploy on Elastic Stack 6.x you _*must*_ use ElastiFlow&trade; 3.4.2 or earlier. The 3.4 branch will be maintained independently of the master branch for a while, as most users are still using a pre-7 release of the Elastic Stack.

Refer to the following compatibility chart to choose a release of ElastiFlow&trade; that is compatible with the version of the Elastic Stack you are using.

Elastic Stack | ElastiFlow&trade; 1.x | ElastiFlow&trade; 2.x | ElastiFlow&trade; 3.x
:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
7.x |  |  | &#10003; v3.5.x
6.7 |  |  | &#10003; v3.4.2
6.6 |  |  | &#10003; v3.4.1
6.5 |  |  | &#10003;
6.4 |  |  | &#10003;
6.3 |  |  | &#10003;
6.2 | &#10003; | &#10003; | &#10003;
6.1 | &#10003; | &#10003; |
6.0 | &#10003; | &#10003; |
5.6 | &#10003; | &#10003; |
5.5 | &#10003; |  |
5.4 | &#10003; |  |

> NOTE: The instructions that follow are for ElastiFlow&trade; 3.5.0 and above on Elastic Stack 7.x.

## Requirements

Please be aware that in production environments the volume of data generated by many network flow sources can be considerable. It is not uncommon for a core router or firewall to produce 1000s of flow records per second. For this reason it is recommended that ElastiFlow&trade; be given its own dedicated Logstash instance. Multiple instances may be necessary as the volume of flow data increases.

> Due to the way NIC receive queues and the Linux kernel interact, raw UDP packet reception will be bound to a single CPU core and kernel receive buffer. While additional UDP input workers allow Logstash to share the load of processing packets from the receive buffer, it does not scale linearly. As worker threads are increased, so is contention for buffer access. The sweetspot seems to be to use 4-core Logstash instances, adding additional instances as needed for high-volume environments.

It is my experience that most people underestimate the volume of flow data their network will produce. Save yourself the headache and don't start too small. Use the following table as a guide:

flows/sec | (v)CPUs | Memory | Disk (30-days) | ES JVM Heap | LS JVM Heap
---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:
250| 4 | 24 GB | 305 GB | 8 GB | 4 GB
1000| 8 | 32 GB | 1.22 TB  | 12 GB | 4 GB
2500| 12 | 64 GB | 3.05 TB | 24 GB | 6 GB

For anything beyond 2500 flows/sec a multi-node cluster should be considered, and that Logstash be run on its own instance/server.

The above recommendations are a starting point. Once you are up and running you can make adjustments based on the actual load of your environment.

> I plan to do some additional benchmarking soon, and will update the above table based on those results.

## Setting up Elasticsearch

Previous versions of ElastiFlow&trade; required no special configuration for Elasticsearch. However changes made to Elasticsearch 7.x, require that the following settings be made in `elasticsearch.yml`:

```text
indices.query.bool.max_clause_count: 8192
search.max_buckets: 100000
```

At high ingest rates (>10K flows/s), or for data redundancy and high availability, a multi-node cluster is recommended.

## Setting up Logstash

> **IMPORTANT!!! If you are upgrading from version 2.x of ElastiFlow&trade; you MUST delete the old** `elastiflow` **index template from Elasticsearch PRIOR to starting Logstash with the v3.0.0 pipeline. This can be done by executing** `DELETE _template/elastiflow` **from Dev Tools --> Console in Kibana. Use** `GET _template` **to confirm that it was deleted.**

The ElastiFlow&trade; Logstash pipeline is the heart of the solution. It is here that the raw flow data is collected, decoded, parsed, formatted and enriched. It is this processing that makes possible the analytics options provided by the Kibana [dashboards](#dashboards).

Follow these steps to ensure that Logstash and ElastiFlow&trade; are optimally configured to meet your needs. 

### 1. Set JVM heap size.

To increase performance, ElastiFlow&trade; takes advantage of the caching and queueing features available in many of the Logstash plugins. These features increase the consumption of the JVM heap. The JVM heap space used by Logstash is configured in `jvm.options`. It is recommended that Logstash be given at least 2GB of JVM heap. If all options, incl. DNS lookups (requires version 3.0.10 or later of the DNS filter), are enabled increase this to 4GB. This is configured in `jvm.options` as follows:

```text
-Xms4g
-Xmx4g
```

### 2. Add and Update Required Logstash plugins

To use ElastiFlow&trade; you will need to install the community supported [sFlow](https://github.com/ashangit/logstash-codec-sflow) codec for Logstash. It is also recommended that you always use the latest version of the [Netflow](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-codecs-netflow.html) codec, the [UDP](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-inputs-udp.html) input, and the [DNS](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-filters-dns.html) filter. This can achieved by running the following commands:

```
LS_HOME/bin/logstash-plugin install logstash-codec-sflow
LS_HOME/bin/logstash-plugin update logstash-codec-netflow
LS_HOME/bin/logstash-plugin update logstash-input-udp
LS_HOME/bin/logstash-plugin update logstash-input-tcp
LS_HOME/bin/logstash-plugin update logstash-filter-dns
LS_HOME/bin/logstash-plugin update logstash-filter-geoip
LS_HOME/bin/logstash-plugin update logstash-filter-translate
```

### 3. Copy the pipeline files to the Logstash configuration path.

There are five sets of configuration files provided within the `logstash/elastiflow` folder:

```text
logstash
  `- elastiflow
       |- conf.d  (contains the logstash pipeline)
       |- definitions  (custom Netflow and IPFIX field definitions)
       |- dictionaries (yaml files used to enrich raw flow data)
       |- geoipdbs  (contains GeoIP databases)
       `- templates  (contains index templates)
```

Copy the `elastiflow` directory to the location of your Logstash configuration files (e.g. on RedHat/CentOS or Ubuntu this would be `/etc/logstash/elastiflow` ). If you place the ElastiFlow&trade; pipeline within a different path, you will need to modify the following environment variables to specify the correct location:

Environment Variable | Description | Default Value
--- | --- | ---
ELASTIFLOW_DICT_PATH | The path where dictionary files are located | /etc/logstash/elastiflow/dictionaries
ELASTIFLOW_TEMPLATE_PATH | The path to where index templates are located | /etc/logstash/elastiflow/templates
ELASTIFLOW_GEOIP_DB_PATH | The path where GeoIP DBs are located | /etc/logstash/elastiflow/geoipdbs

### 4. Setup environment variable helper files

Rather than directly editing the pipeline configuration files for your environment, environment variables are used to provide a single location for most configuration options. These environment variables will be referred to in the remaining instructions. A [reference](#environment-variable-reference) of all environment variables can be found [here](#environment-variable-reference).

Depending on your environment there may be many ways to define environment variables. The files `profile.d/elastiflow.sh` and `logstash.service.d/elastiflow.conf` are provided to help you with this setup.

Recent versions of both RedHat/CentOS and Ubuntu use systemd to start background processes. When deploying ElastiFlow&trade; on a host where Logstash will be managed by systemd, copy `logstash.service.d/elastiflow.conf` to `/etc/systemd/system/logstash.service.d/elastiflow.conf`. Any configuration changes can then be made by editing this file.

> Remember that for your changes to take effect, you must issue the command `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`.

### 5. Add the ElastiFlow&trade; pipeline to pipelines.yml

Logstash 6.0 introduced the ability to run multiple pipelines from a single Logstash instance. The `pipelines.yml` file is where these pipelines are configured. While a single pipeline can be specified directly in `logstash.yml`, it is a good practice to use `pipelines.yml` for consistency across environments.

Edit `pipelines.yml` (usually located at `/etc/logstash/pipelines.yml`) and add the ElastiFlow&trade; pipeline (adjust the path as necessary).

```text
- pipeline.id: elastiflow
  path.config: "/etc/logstash/elastiflow/conf.d/*.conf"
```

### 6. Configure inputs

By default flow data will be recieved on all IPv4 addresses of the Logstash host using the standard ports for each flow type. You can change both the IPs and ports used by modifying the following environment variables:

Environment Variable | Description | Default Value
--- | --- | ---
ELASTIFLOW_NETFLOW_IPV4_HOST | The IP address from which to listen for Netflow messages | 0.0.0.0
ELASTIFLOW_NETFLOW_IPV4_PORT | The UDP port on which to listen for Netflow messages | 2055
ELASTIFLOW_SFLOW_IPV4_HOST | The IP address from which to listen for sFlow messages | 0.0.0.0
ELASTIFLOW_SFLOW_IPV4_PORT | The UDP port on which to listen for sFlow messages | 6343
ELASTIFLOW_IPFIX_TCP_IPV4_HOST | The IP address from which to listen for IPFIX messages via TCP | 0.0.0.0
ELASTIFLOW_IPFIX_TCP_IPV4_PORT | The port on which to listen for IPFIX messages via TCP | 4739
ELASTIFLOW_IPFIX_UDP_IPV4_HOST | The IP address from which to listen for IPFIX messages via UDP | 0.0.0.0
ELASTIFLOW_IPFIX_UDP_IPV4_PORT | The port on which to listen for IPFIX messages via UDP | 4739

Collection of flows over IPv6 is disabled by default to avoid issues on systems without IPv6 enabled. To enable IPv6 rename the following files in the `elastiflow/conf.d` directory, removing `.disabled` from the end of the name: `10_input_ipfix_ipv6.logstash.conf.disabled`, `10_input_netflow_ipv6.logstash.conf.disabled`, `10_input_sflow_ipv6.logstash.conf.disabled`. Similiar to IPv4, the IPv6 input can be configured using environment variables:

Environment Variable | Description | Default Value
--- | --- | ---
ELASTIFLOW_NETFLOW_IPV6_HOST | The IP address from which to listen for Netflow messages | [::]
ELASTIFLOW_NETFLOW_IPV6_PORT | The UDP port on which to listen for Netflow messages | 52055
ELASTIFLOW_SFLOW_IPV6_HOST | The IP address from which to listen for sFlow messages | [::]
ELASTIFLOW_SFLOW_IPV6_PORT | The UDP port on which to listen for sFlow messages | 56343
ELASTIFLOW_IPFIX_TCP_IPV6_HOST | The IP address from which to listen for IPFIX messages via TCP | [::]
ELASTIFLOW_IPFIX_TCP_IPV6_PORT | The port on which to listen for IPFIX messages via TCP | 54739
ELASTIFLOW_IPFIX_UDP_IPV6_HOST | The IP address from which to listen for IPFIX messages via UDP | [::]
ELASTIFLOW_IPFIX_UDP_IPV6_PORT | The port on which to listen for IPFIX messages via UDP | 54739

To improve UDP input performance for high volume flow collection, the default values for UDP input `workers` and `queue_size` are increased. The default values are `2` and `2000` respecitvely. ElastiFlow&trade; increases these to `4` and `4096`. Further tuning is possible using the following environment variables.

Environment Variable | Description | Default Value
--- | --- | ---
ELASTIFLOW_NETFLOW_UDP_WORKERS | The number of Netflow input threads | 4
ELASTIFLOW_NETFLOW_UDP_QUEUE_SIZE | The number of unprocessed Netflow UDP packets the input can buffer | 4096
ELASTIFLOW_NETFLOW_UDP_RCV_BUFF | The socket receive buffer size (bytes) for Netflow | 33554432
ELASTIFLOW_SFLOW_UDP_WORKERS | The number of sFlow input threads | 4
ELASTIFLOW_SFLOW_UDP_QUEUE_SIZE | The number of unprocessed sFlow UDP packets the input can buffer | 4096
ELASTIFLOW_SFLOW_UDP_RCV_BUFF | The socket receive buffer size (bytes) for sFlow | 33554432
ELASTIFLOW_IPFIX_UDP_WORKERS | The number of IPFIX input threads | 4
ELASTIFLOW_IPFIX_UDP_QUEUE_SIZE | The number of unprocessed IPFIX UDP packets the input can buffer | 4096
ELASTIFLOW_IPFIX_UDP_RCV_BUFF | The socket receive buffer size (bytes) for IPFIX | 33554432

> WARNING! Increasing `queue_size` will increase heap_usage. Make sure have configured JVM heap appropriately as specified in the [Requirements](#requirements)

### 7. Configure the Elasticsearch output

Obviously the data needs to land in Elasticsearch, so you need to tell Logstash where to send it.

The default is to send data to only a single Elasticsearch node. This node is specified using the following environment variable:

Environment Variable | Description | Default Value
--- | --- | ---
ELASTIFLOW_ES_HOST | The Elasticsearch host to which the output will send data | 127.0.0.1:9200

Optionally Logstash can be configured to use an array of three Elasticsearch nodes. This is done by completing the following steps:

1. Rename `30_output_10_single.logstash.conf` to `30_output_10_single.logstash.conf.disabled`
2. Rename `30_output_20_multi.logstash.conf.disabled` to `30_output_20_multi.logstash.conf`
3. Set the following environment variables:

Environment Variable | Description | Default Value
--- | --- | ---
ELASTIFLOW_ES_HOST_1 | The first Elasticsearch host to which the output will send data | 127.0.0.1:9200
ELASTIFLOW_ES_HOST_2 | The second Elasticsearch host to which the output will send data | 127.0.0.2:9200
ELASTIFLOW_ES_HOST_3 | The third Elasticsearch host to which the output will send data | 127.0.0.3:9200

To complete the setup of the Elasticsearch output, configure the following environment variables as required for your environment:

Environment Variable | Description | Default Value
--- | --- | ---
ELASTIFLOW_ES_USER | The username for the connection to Elasticsearch | elastic
ELASTIFLOW_ES_PASSWD | The password for the connection to Elasticsearch | changeme
ELASTIFLOW_ES_SSL_ENABLE | Enable or disable SSL connection to Elasticsearch | false
ELASTIFLOW_ES_SSL_VERIFY | Enable or disable verification of the SSL certificate. If enabled, the output must be edited to set the path to the certificate. | false

> If you are only using the open-source version of Elasticsearch, it will ignore the username and password. In that case just leave the defaults.

> If `ELASTIFLOW_ES_SSL_ENABLE` and `ELASTIFLOW_ES_SSL_VERIFY` are both `true`, you must uncomment the `cacert` option in the Elasticsearch output and set the path to the certificate.

### 8. Enable DNS name resolution (optional)

In the past it was recommended to avoid DNS queries as the latency costs of such lookups had a devastating effect on throughput. While the Logstash DNS filter provides a caching mechanism, its use was not recommended. When the cache was enabled all lookups were performed synchronously. If a name server failed to respond, all other queries were stuck waiting until the query timed out. The end result was even worse performance.

Fortunately these problems have been resolved. Release 3.0.8 of the DNS filter introduced an enhancement which caches timeouts as failures, in addition to normal NXDOMAIN responses. This was an important step as many domain owner intentionally setup their nameservers to ignore the reverse lookups needed to enrich flow data. In addition to this change, I submitted am enhancement which allows for concurrent queries when caching is enabled. The Logstash team approved this change, and it is included in 3.0.10 of the plugin.

With these changes I can finally give the green light for using DNS lookups to enrich the incoming flow data. You will see a little slow down in throughput until the cache warms up, but that usually lasts only a few minutes. Once the cache is warmed up, the overhead is minimal, and event rates averaging 10K/s and as high as 40K/s were observed in testing.

The key to good performance is setting up the cache appropriately. Most likely it will be DNS timeouts that are the source of most latency. So ensuring that a higher volume of such misses can be cached for longer periods of time is most important.

The DNS lookup features of ElastiFlow&trade; can be configured using the following environment variables:

Environment Variable | Description | Default Value
--- | --- | ---
ELASTIFLOW_RESOLVE_IP2HOST | Enable/Disable DNS requests. Possible values are `exporters` (only flow exporter IPs are resolved), `endpoints` (only endpoint IPs, src/dst, are resolved), `true` (both are resolved) or `false` | false
ELASTIFLOW_NAMESERVER | The DNS server to which the dns filter should send requests | 127.0.0.1
ELASTIFLOW_DNS_HIT_CACHE_SIZE | The cache size for successful DNS queries | 25000
ELASTIFLOW_DNS_HIT_CACHE_TTL | The time in seconds successful DNS queries are cached | 900
ELASTIFLOW_DNS_FAILED_CACHE_SIZE | The cache size for failed DNS queries | 75000
ELASTIFLOW_DNS_FAILED_CACHE_TTL | The time in seconds failed DNS queries are cached | 3600

### 9. Configure Application ID enrichment (optional)

Both Netflow and IPFIX allow devices with application identification features to specify the application associated with the traffic in the flow. For Netflow this is the `application_id` field. The IPFIX field is `applicationId`.

The application names which correspond to values of these IDs is vendor-specific. In order for ElastiFlow&trade; to accurately translate the ID values, it must be told the type of device that is exporting the flows. To do so you must edit `elastiflow/dictionaries/app_id_srctype.yml` and specify the source type of your supported device. For example...

```text
"192.0.2.1": "cisco_nbar2"
"192.0.2.2": "fortinet"
```

> Currently supported is Cisco's NBAR2 and Fortinet's FortiOS. If you have a device that you would like added, I will need a mapping of Application IDs to names. This can often be extracted from the device's configuration. I would love to be able to build up a large knowledge base of such mappings.

You can also define a default source type value by setting the following environment variable:

Environment Variable | Description | Default Value
--- | --- | ---
ELASTIFLOW_DEFAULT_APPID_SRCTYPE | Sets the default source type for translating the App IDs to names. Valid values are `cisco_nbar2` and `fortinet` | __UNKNOWN

Application identity is also supported from the following sources, and requires no additional configuration:

* Citrix Netscaler
* IXIA IxFlow
* ntop nProbe (An nProbe configuration file that works well with ElastiFlow&trade; is available [HERE](https://gist.github.com/robcowart/afd538026db29ee96dd9c495efb52ea6))
* Palo Alto
* SonicWall
* Sophos

Once configured ElastiFlow&trade; will resolve the ID to an application name, which will be available in the dashboards.

### 10. Manually set the sampling interval for devices that don't send it. (optional)

Some devices which collect sampled flows do not include the sampling interval in the flow records that they send (e.g. some Cisco IOS XR and Huawei devices). In such situations the sampling interval can be set manually by adding the IP address and sampling rate for the device in `elastiflow/dictionaries/sampling_interval.yml`.

### 11. Start Logstash

You should now be able to start Logstash and begin collecting network flow data. Assuming you are running a recent version of RedHat/CentOS or Ubuntu, and using systemd, complete these steps:

1. Run `systemctl daemon-reload` to ensure any changes to the environment variables are recognized.
2. Run `systemctl start logstash`

> NOTICE! Make sure that you have already setup the Logstash init files by running `LS_HOME/bin/system-install`. If the init files have not been setup you will receive an error.

To follow along as Logstash starts you can tail its log by running:

```text
tail -f /var/log/logstash/logstash-plain.log
```

**Logstash takes a little time to start... BE PATIENT!**

If using Netflow v9 or IPFIX you will likely see warning messages related to the flow templates not yet being received. They will disappear after templates are received from the network devices, which should happen every few minutes. Some devices can take a bit longer to send templates. Fortinet in particular send templates rather infrequently.

Logstash setup is now complete. If you are receiving flow data, you should have an `elastiflow-` daily index in Elasticsearch.

## Setting up Kibana

Kibana 6.5 introduced the ability to export and import Index Patterns through the UI. This greatly simplifies the setup of Kibana.

### Kibana 6.5.x and Later

The Index Patterns, vizualizations and dashboards can be loaded into Kibana by importing the `elastiflow.kibana.<VER>.json` file from within the Kibana UI. This is done from the `Management -> Saved Objects` page.

### Kibana 6.4.x and Earlier

An API (yet undocumented) is available to import and export Index Patterns. The JSON file which contains the Index Pattern configuration is `kibana/elastiflow.index_pattern.json`. To setup the `elastiflow-*` Index Pattern run the following command:

```text
curl -X POST -u USERNAME:PASSWORD http://KIBANASERVER:5601/api/saved_objects/index-pattern/elastiflow-* -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "kbn-xsrf: true" -d @/PATH/TO/elastiflow.index_pattern.json
```

Finally the vizualizations and dashboards can be loaded into Kibana by importing the `elastiflow.dashboards.<VER>.json` file from within the Kibana UI. This is done from the `Management -> Saved Objects` page. There are separate dashboard import files for version 6.2.x, 6.3.x and 6.4.x of Kibana. Select the file that corresponds to your version of Kibana.

### Recommended Kibana Advanced Settings

You may find that modifying a few of the Kibana advanced settings will produce a more user-friendly experience while using ElastiFlow&trade;. These settings are made in Kibana, under `Management -> Advanced Settings`.

Advanced Setting | Value | Why make the change?
--- | --- | ---
doc_table:highlight | false | There is a pretty big query performance penalty that comes with using the highlighting feature. As it isn't very useful for this use-case, it is better to just trun it off.
filters:pinnedByDefault | true | Pinning a filter will it allow it to persist when you are changing dashbaords. This is very useful when drill-down into something of interest and you want to change dashboards for a different perspective of the same data. This is the first setting I change whenever I am working with Kibana.
state:storeInSessionStorage | true | Kibana URLs can get pretty large. Especially when working with Vega visualizations. This will likely result in error messages for users of Internet Explorer. Using in-session storage will fix this issue for these users.
timepicker:quickRanges | [see below](#recommended-setting-for-timepicker:quickRanges) | The default options in the Time Picker are less than optimal, for most logging and monitoring use-cases. Fortunately Kibana now allows you to customize the time picker. Our recommended settings can be found [see below](#recommended-setting-for-timepicker:quickRanges).

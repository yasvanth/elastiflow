I was inspired to create ElastiFlow&trade; following the overwhelmingly positive feedback received to an article I posted on Linkedin... [WTFlow?! Are you really still paying for commercial solutions to collect and analyze network flow data?](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/wtflow-you-really-still-paying-commercial-solutions-collect-cowart)

## Getting Started

> NOTE: Elastic Stack 7.x _*requires*_ ElastiFlow&trade; 3.5.x. To deploy on Elastic Stack 6.x you _*must*_ use ElastiFlow&trade; 3.4.2 or earlier. The 3.4 branch will be maintained independently of the master branch for a while, as most users are still using a pre-7 release of the Elastic Stack.

ElastiFlow&trade; is built using the Elastic Stack, including Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana. Please refer to [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/robcowart/elastiflow/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for instructions on how to install and configure ElastiFlow&trade;

### Threats

ElastiFlow&trade; includes a dictionary of public IP addresses that are known to have a poor reputation. This dictionary is built from many OSINT data sources, normalized to a common taxonomy. The Threats dashboard uses this IP reputation information to highlight three threat/risk types.

1. Public Threats - Public clients with a poor IP reputation that are reaching private addresses.
2. At-Risk Servers - Private Servers that are being reached by clients with a poor IP reputation.
3. High-Risk Clients - Private clients that are accessing public servers which have a poor reputation.
